<h1> Config File Specifications/Information </h1>
Last Updated: June 29th, 2020

<h3>The config file allows empty rows and comments ("//" at start of comment line) for formatting the presentation of the contents, currently does NOT allow in-line comments or spaces in variable assignments</h3>
<h3>The parsing process currently does not attempt any verification of assigning values to variables (lack of assignment nor duplications).</h3>
<h3>For changing what config file is used, the file address can be changed where cudaConstants is declared within the main function</h3>
<h3>If config file address is invalid, will output to terminal that is the case.  Also assumption is made that the config file contains valid values for all variables</h3>
<h3>Default address is "genetic.config", must be in same folder as the .exe file, optimization.cu has address set as "../Config_Constants/genetic.config".
<h3>In the code, the structure that uses the config file is called <b>cudaConstants</b></h3>
<h3>Other functions include an overloaded << operator for cudaConstants that outputs the object's contents with labelling/formatting for better readibility when outputting onto terminal screen.  Also function compareConstants() takes in two const cudaConstants that returns true if all variables are equivalent, used in the genetic algorithm as means of verifying that the values are not changing during runtime.</h3>
