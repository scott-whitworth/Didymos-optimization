* CalculateEngineParameters: 
. massStruct --> needs to be not a constant --> later?
. Why is initialMass = dryMass + massFuel; the same for RETURN and FORWARD? Is the massFuel of the RETURN already included in the dryMass of the FORWARD somewhere else?

* CalcEarthConditions:
. Ensure that Earth data is for the appropriate range of dates. --> Connection to GetCloseApproach?

* EscapeEarth:
. Need to keep track of C3 at ESOI.

* Zombie files

* Revised flowchart
