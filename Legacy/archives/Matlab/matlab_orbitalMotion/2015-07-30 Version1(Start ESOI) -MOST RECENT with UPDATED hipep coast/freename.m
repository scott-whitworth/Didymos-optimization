%FREENAME Finds first untaken name when writing a file

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%This function downloaded from the Internet is used when saving
%graphs of trajectory data. A way was needed to guarante a unique
%filename. Considered generating a sufficiently large random number so
%the chance of overwriting was small but this is a more elegant solution.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The function finds first unused name of a file in a required directory.
% The final name of the file consists of a name base appended by n digits
% (possibly with leading zeros) expressing an order of the new file
% possessing the same name base. The function is good for generating names 
% of files containing results of an alternative processing of the same data.
%
% Forms of calls:
% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%   filename = freename(dirname,base);
%       dirname  = name of the directory, where to find a new name
%       base     = base of the new name (without extension)
%   filename = freename(dirname,base,n);
%       n        = number of figures to be appended (3 is default)
%       filename = free name equals a base appended by 'n' figure characters
%
% Examples:
% ~~~~~~~~
%   filename =[freename('Results','meas',2) '.txt'];
%       The name 'meas01.txt' will be sent to filename if there is no file
%       of the same base name 'meas' present in the subdirectory 'Results'.
%       The name 'meas04.txt' is returned provided 'meas03' exists in the
%       subdirectory 'Results'.
%   file = [freename('./', 'data') '.dat'];
%       returns 'data001.dat' if no file file with the base name 'data'
%       exists in the current directory.
