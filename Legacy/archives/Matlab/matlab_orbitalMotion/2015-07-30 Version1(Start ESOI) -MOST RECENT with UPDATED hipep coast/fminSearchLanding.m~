%This function is passed to fminsearch and acts as the objective function
%and as such has to conform to a strict format where it takes a vector of
%independent variables and returns a funciton value.  The purpose of the
%function is to evaluate the coefficients it is passed such that the global
%minimum of the function occurs when the ship lands on the asteroid.  To do
%that it integrates the ships motion and then combines all of the ship and
%asteroid final positions in one number that represents error.

%called by the fminsearch used in timeObjectiveFunction
function F = landingObjectiveFunction(c)
%**********************************************
%Global Constants
% global GC_ARF;      %Asteroid final radius
% global GC_AUF;      %Asteroid final radial velocity
% global GC_AHF;      %Asteroid final h
% global GC_ATF;      %Asteroid final theta
%**********************************************

%this function integrates the ships motion a given time length for a given
%set of phi coefficients (c)  It returns vectors for time and position
%variables but only the position variables interest us

if strcmpi(direction, 'return')
    [~,Y] = IntegrateShipMotion(c,[timeTest-escapeTime,0],order,direction,uexhaust,a0,a0_earth,escapeVelocity,EarthEscapeAngle,earthConditions);
elseif strcmpi(direction, 'forward')
    [~,Y] = IntegrateShipMotion(c,[escapeTime, timeTest],order,direction,uexhaust,a0,a0_earth,escapeVelocity,EarthEscapeAngle,earthConditions);
end

%this is the objective function, it is minimized when the final values of
%radius, radius prime, h, and theta are equal to those of the asteroid.
F = (Y(end,1)-GC_ARF)^2+(Y(end,2)-GC_ATF)^2+(Y(end,3)-GC_AUF)^2+(Y(end,4)-GC_AHF)^2;
